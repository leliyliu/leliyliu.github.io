It’t our inner terror that makes us to be hesitated and not dare to make decisions. only if we can get out of our own comfortable zone, we will have the ability to get over our inner fear and be a true warrior. keep in mind that there is always somewhere you can get comfort.  </p>

Only at the opposite of happiness we can truly understand what happiness really means. Such as Friedrich von Schiller says “Freedom is precious, because at the opposite of this mandatory, we are able to see we have the right to choose.” Happiness is so same a thing compare to freedom.</p>

We have to study, have to work, have to make livings for ourselves. But you can’t say that our lives have no meaning. Like the sonnet, the form may looks alike, but the emotion and content are quite different. </p>

Why they can travel faster than light? you should know that light doesn’t travel through straight line spatially, but it choose the shortest way affected by space and time(or by gravitation). So if we can travel through straight line, we can travel faster than light spatially.</p>

But what on earth IT means? It’s a higher dimensional creature, so it has tremendous power to beat all the persons. But as the novel wants to tell us, the monster doesn’t have emotion, especially love. So it can’t feel how strong love is, and finally it failed. But why a higher dimensional creature has more power than a lower one?  </p>

According to father’s behaviour, we can see that if we are absorbed in the truth(intellect), we may get some wrong and we can be beated easily. Life is not always about logos and science, but also emotion. we human beings are different because of our abundant emotions.  </p>

And she also realize that her difference made her so special. So we are supposed to have our own special character. So that the whole world can be interesting and our own life will be fun.  </p>
