            <blockquote>
<p>Even in its earlier phases, analytic philosophy was difficult to define in terms of its intrinsic features or fundamental philosophical commitments. Consequently, it has always relied on contrasts with other approaches to philosophy—especially approaches to which it found itself fundamentally opposed—to help clarify its own nature. Initially, it was opposed to British Idealism, and then to “traditional philosophy” at large. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>&emsp; 即使是在分析哲学的早期阶段，其也很难用本质的特征和其它基本的哲学要素来定义。因此，它依赖于和其他哲学方式，尤其是哪些它所主张反对的哲学方式来形成对立，并以此来说明分析哲学本质的特点。起初，它反对的是英国唯心主义，然后扩大到反对传统哲学研究（即形而上学）</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Later, it found itself opposed both to classical Phenomenology (for example, Husserl) and its offspring, such as Existentialism (Sartre, Camus, and so forth) and also “Continental”’ or “Postmodern” philosophy (Heidegger, Foucault and Derrida). Though classical Pragmatism bears some similarity to early analytic philosophy, especially in the work of C. S. Peirce and C. I. Lewis, the pragmatists are usually understood as constituting a separate tradition or school.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>&emsp;之后，分析哲学不但反对传统现象学（例如，胡塞尔）并且它的后继学说，例如存在主义（萨特，加缪等等）和“欧陆哲学”或者“后现代哲学”（海德格尔， 傅科，德里达)。尽管传统的实用主义哲学在某些方面和早期的分析哲学较为相似，尤其是皮尔斯和刘易斯所作的工作中，但实用主义者通常被理解为一个分离于传统哲学或经院哲学之外的组织。</p>
<h3 id="1-The-Revolution-of-Moore-and-Russell-Cambridge-Realism-and-The-Linguistic-Turn"><a href="#1-The-Revolution-of-Moore-and-Russell-Cambridge-Realism-and-The-Linguistic-Turn" class="headerlink" title="1. The Revolution of Moore and Russell: Cambridge Realism and The Linguistic Turn"></a>1. The Revolution of Moore and Russell: Cambridge Realism and The Linguistic Turn</h3><blockquote>
<p>“It was towards the end of 1898,” wrote Bertrand Russell,<br>that Moore and I rebelled against both Kant and Hegel. Moore led the way, but I followed closely in his footsteps…. I felt a great liberation, as if I had escaped from a hot house onto a windswept headland. In the first exuberance of liberation, I became a naïve realist and rejoiced in the thought that grass really is green. (Russell 1959, 22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>&emsp;罗素回忆，“那是1898年的年末，穆尔和我开始反对康德和黑格尔的哲学观点。穆尔开创了这一新的方向，并且我紧随他的步伐，我感到完全地解放，就像我刚从一个温暖的屋子中逃出到一个暴露在风雨中的山岬。起初，由于心中洋溢着自由的喜悦，我成为了一个朴素的现实主义者，并且开心地认为草真的是绿的（暗示我们所见的即为真实，标准的现实主义者的看法）（罗素，1959,22）</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This important event in Russell’s own intellectual history turned out to be decisive for the history of twentieth-century philosophy as a whole; for it was this revolutionary break with British Idealism—then the most influential school of philosophical thought in the British universities—that birthed analytic philosophy and set it on the path to supplanting both Idealism and philosophy as traditionally conceived and practiced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>&emsp;这个发生于罗素个人发展历史中的重要事件也成为了整个二十世纪哲学史上的关键时刻。由于它是一个具有革命性的节点——反对英国唯心主义（最有影响力的哲学学派在英国大学中）——然后诞生出了分析哲学并且指出了一条代替唯心主义和传统哲学的新的道路。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To understand Russell’s elation at the rebellion, one needs to know something about him and also something about British Idealism. Let’s begin with the latter.<br><br>&emsp;为了理解罗素为何对于这次解放如此兴奋，我们需要了解罗素本人以及一些关于英国唯心主义的知识。所以让我们从下面开始吧。</p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, F.H. Bradley, Bernard Bosanquet, and J.M.E. McTaggart were the leading British Idealists. They claimed that the world, although it naively appears to us to be a collection of discrete objects (this bird, that table, the earth and the sun, and so forth), is really a single indivisible whole whose nature is mental, or spiritual, or Ideal rather than material. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>&emsp;在十九世纪的末端， F.H. Bradley, Bernard Bosanquet, and J.M.E. McTaggart是英国唯心主义的主要领导人物。他们声称这个世界，尽管从表面上呈现给我们的是一种离散的物体的集合，实际上是一个本质为精神，或者心灵而不是物质上的整体。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, idealism was a brand of metaphysical monism, but not a form of materialism, the other leading form of metaphysical monism. It was also a form of what we would now call anti-realism, since it claimed that the world of naïve or ordinary experience is something of an illusion. Their claim was not that the objects of ordinary experience do not exist, but that they are not, as we normally take them to be, discrete. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>&emsp;因此，唯心主义实际上是形而上学一元论的一种表现形式，而不是形而上学一元论的另一种唯物主义的形式。同时，它也是一种反实在论的表现形式，因为他们声称关于日常或朴素的经验完全是一种错觉。他们声称，并不是我们日常所经验到的这些物质不存在，而是他们不是以我们所认为的离散的方式而存在。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, every object exists and is what it is at least partly in virtue of the relations it bears to other things—more precisely, to all other things. This was called the doctrine of internal relations. Since, on this view, everything that exists does so only in virtue of its relations to everything else, it is misleading to say of any one thing that it exists simpliciter. The only thing that exists simpliciter is the whole—the entire network of necessarily related objects. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>&emsp;相反地，每种物体都存在，并且是以一种和其它物质至少部分相联系的方式而存在，或者更确切的说，是与每一种其它的物体相联系。因此，以这种观点来看，每个物体都是因和其它所有物体所相联系而存在，故如果说，任何一个物体绝对地存在，那么必然是一种误解。唯一绝对存在的事物就是整体，整个必要事物相联系的关系。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Correspondingly, the Idealists believed that no statement about some isolated object could be true simpliciter, since, on their view, to speak of an object in isolation would be to ignore the greater part of the truth about it, namely, its relations to everything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>&emsp;因此，唯心主义者认为，任何关于一些孤立物体的论述都不能绝对地正确，因此，从他们的角度来看，如果单独言说一个孤立的物体，将会错过绝大部分有关于此的</p>

<p>在这里我尝试对Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy 中的Analytic Philosophy 部分作一个翻译，来增强我对分析哲学的理解，同时也是一个小结吧，希望每周能更新4-5次</p>
<h2 id="Analytic-Philosophy"><a href="#Analytic-Philosophy" class="headerlink" title="Analytic Philosophy"></a>Analytic Philosophy</h2><blockquote>
<p>The school of analytic philosophy has dominated academic philosophy in various regions, most notably Great Britain and the United States, since the early twentieth century. It originated around the turn of the twentieth century as G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell broke away from what was then the dominant school in the British universities, Absolute Idealism. Many would also include GottlobFrege as a founder of analytic philosophy in the late 19th century, and this controversial issue is discussed in section 2c. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&emsp; 二十世纪早期以来，分析哲学学派在多方面占据了哲学学术研究的主导地位，尤其是在英美两国。穆尔和罗素在二十世纪初脱离了当时在英国经院中处于统治地位的绝对唯心主义，开创了分析哲学。许多人也将弗洛伊德作为分析哲学在十九世纪末的创始人之一，这个具有争议的问题将在2c中进行讨论。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Moore and Russell articulated their alternative to Idealism, they used a linguistic idiom, frequently basing their arguments on the “meanings” of terms and propositions. Additionally, Russell believed that the grammar of natural language often is philosophically misleading, and that the way to dispel the illusion is to re-express propositions in the ideal formal language of symbolic logic, thereby revealing their true logical form. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&emsp;当穆尔和罗素从理想主义转向的时候，他们运用了一种语言学的方式，即他们经常使用的关于论题的意义的讨论，来指出他们新的研究方向。除此之外，罗素认为自然语言的语法在哲学层面通常会误导他人，而消解这种误解的方式就是通过那些可以揭示实际论点的逻辑形式的逻辑符号所规定的理想语言来重新表述论点本身。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of this emphasis on language, analytic philosophy was widely, though perhaps mistakenly, taken to involve a turn toward language as the subject matter of philosophy, and it was taken to involve an accompanying methodological turn toward linguistic analysis. Thus, on the traditional view, analytic philosophy was born in this linguistic turn. The linguistic conception of philosophy was rightly seen as novel in the history of philosophy. For this reason analytic philosophy is reputed to have originated in a philosophical revolution on the grand scale—not merely in a revolt against British Idealism, but against traditional philosophy on the whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&emsp;由于对语言的强调，分析哲学被广泛但可能错误地认为是哲学的语言性转向的参与者，同时也是语言学分析方法转向的参与者。因此，以传统的观点看，分析哲学诞生于语言学转向。在哲学漫长的历史进程中，语言学的概念才刚开始兴起。由于这个原因，分析哲学被认为是在整个哲学研究方面发起了一项完全的革命，它不仅仅是对于英国唯心主义的反叛，而是对整个传统哲学的转向。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Analytic philosophy underwent several internal micro-revolutions that divide its history into five phases. The first phase runs approximately from 1900 to 1910. It is characterized by the quasi-Platonic form of realism initially endorsed by Moore and Russell as an alternative to Idealism. Their realism was expressed and defended in the idiom of “propositions” and “meanings,” so it was taken to involve a turn toward language. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&emsp;在分析哲学的发展历史中，由于其内部小的革命，可以分为五个阶段。第一阶段是从1900年到1910年。它的标志是由穆尔和罗素为发动对唯心主义转向而提出的准柏拉图形式实在论。他们所提出的实在论观点以“论题”和“意义”的表达为核心，所以它也涉及到了语言学的转向。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But its other significant feature is its turn away from the method of doing philosophy by proposing grand systems or broad syntheses and its turn toward the method of offering narrowly focused discussions that probe a specific, isolated issue with precision and attention to detail. By 1910, both Moore and Russell had abandoned their propositional realism—Moore in favor of a realistic philosophy of common sense, Russell in favor of a view he developed with Ludwig Wittgenstein called logical atomism. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&emsp;但是他们所提出的实在论的其他的显著特点在于它指出了一种对于哲学研究方法上的改变，即不再通过提出宏大的系统或广泛的综合来进行研究，而是特别地着眼于一个特定的，孤立的论点和问题。到了1910年，穆尔和罗素都抛弃了他们所提出的这一实在论，并在此之后，穆尔支持并着眼于对于哲学日常语言的研究，而罗素则开始对他和维特根斯坦一同提出的逻辑原子论的研究。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The turn to logical atomism and to ideal-language analysis characterizes the second phase of analytic philosophy, approximately 1910-1930. The third phase, approximately 1930-1945, is characterized by the rise of logical positivism, a view developed by the members of the Vienna Circle and popularized by the British philosopher A. J. Ayer. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&emsp;发生于1910到1930期间的这样一次关于逻辑原子论和理想语言分析的转向，标志着分析哲学的第二阶段的诞生。而分析哲学的第三个阶段，出现在1930-1945年前后。它的标志是由维也纳学派所提出和发展，并由英国哲学家A. J. Ayer(艾耶尔)所推广的逻辑实证主义的兴起。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fourth phase, approximately 1945-1965, is characterized by the turn to ordinary-language analysis, developed in various ways by the Cambridge philosophers Ludwig Wittgenstein and John Wisdom, and the Oxford </p>
</blockquote>
<p>philosophers Gilbert Ryle, John Austin, Peter Strawson, and Paul Grice.<br>&emsp;第四个阶段，发生于1945-1965年前后，其主要标志是由剑桥哲学家维特根斯坦、John Wisdom(威兹德姆)和牛津大学的哲学家 Gilbert Ryle, John Austin, Peter Strawson, and Paul Grice从多方面提出的日常语言分析的转向。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the 1960s, criticism from within and without caused the analytic movement to abandon its linguistic form. Linguistic philosophy gave way to the philosophy of language, the philosophy of language gave way to metaphysics, and this gave way to a variety of philosophical sub-disciplines. Thus the fifth phase, beginning in the mid 1960s and continuing beyond the end of the twentieth century, is characterized by eclecticism or pluralism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&emsp;在二十世纪六十年代，由于来自内部和外部的批评，分析哲学运动放弃了它的语言学形式。语言哲学让位于哲学语言，而哲学语言又继续让位于对于形而上学的研究，而这进一步引起了有关哲学的多种类型的分支学科的兴起。因此，第五阶段，诞生于二十世纪六十年代中期，并且持续到二十世纪末，其主要标志是折衷主义和多元主义。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This post-linguistic analytic philosophy cannot be defined in terms of a common set of philosophical views or interests, but it can be loosely characterized in terms of its style, which tends to emphasize precision and thoroughness about a narrow topic and to deemphasize the imprecise or cavalier discussion of broad topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&emsp;这个后语言学分析哲学不能按照传统的哲学观点来进行解释和考察，但是从宽泛的角度来进行理解，其倾向为强调准确和完全地对一个特定的哲学论题进行研究，而不是从宽泛的角度对一个宏大的哲学问题进行探讨。</p>

He prove that the axiom of Aristotle is wrong.<br><br>&emsp; An influential claim is that, as a matter of historical fact, modern science was born in the early seventeenth century when the strategy of taking the facts of observation seriously as the basis for science was first seriously adopted.  </p>
<p><font color="green">three components:</font><br><br>(a)Facts are directly given to careful, unprejudiced observers via the senses<br><br>(b)Facts are prior to and independent of theory<br><br>(c)Facts constitute a firm and reliable foundation for scientific knowledge</p>
<h3 id="Seeing-is-believing"><a href="#Seeing-is-believing" class="headerlink" title="Seeing is believing"></a>Seeing is believing</h3><p>this statement is wrong because that we human beings see things using eyes, but our information got by eye is not influenced by our eyesight, but our brain</p>

But we can also see it in another way. even some African people can’t imagine a three-dimensional object like this.<br><br>&emsp;It would seem that there is a sense in which what an observer sees is affected by his or her past experience.<br><br>&emsp;eg2:a medical student attending a course in the X-ray diagnosis of pulmonary diseases. At first, he can’t see what professors talk about. but after a long time study, he can focus on the difference of different picture.<br><br>&emsp;The experienced and skilled observer does not have preceptual experiences identical to those of the untrained novice when the two confront the same situation.<br><br>&emsp;<font color="red">summary:</font> We cannot see just what we like. However, although the images on our retinas form part of the cause of what we see, another very important part of the cause is the inner state of our minds or brains, which will itself depend on our cultural upbringing, our knowledge and our expecatations, and will not be determined solely by the physical properties of our eyes and the scene observed.</p>
<h3 id="Observable-facts-expressed-as-statements"><a href="#Observable-facts-expressed-as-statements" class="headerlink" title="Observable facts expressed as statements"></a>Observable facts expressed as statements</h3><p>As well as distinguishing facts, understood as statements, from the states of affairs described by those statements, it is also clearly necessary to distinguish statements of facts from the preceptions that might occasion the acceptance of those statements as facts.<br><br>&emsp;eg:try to know how children learn what apple is.<br><br>&emsp;<font color="red">summary:</font>Thus, the recording of observable facts requires more than the reception of the stimuli, in the form of light rays ,that impinge on the eye. It requires the knowledge of the appropriate conceptual scheme and how to apply it.</p>
<h3 id="Why-should-facts-precede-theory"><a href="#Why-should-facts-precede-theory" class="headerlink" title="Why should facts precede theory?"></a>Why should facts precede theory?</h3><p><font color="red">summary:</font>The idea that scientific knowledge should be based on facts established by observation need not be undermined, then, by the acknowledgment that the search for and formulation of those facts are knowledge-dependent.</p>
<h3 id="The-fallibility-of-observation-statements"><a href="#The-fallibility-of-observation-statements" class="headerlink" title="The fallibility of observation statements"></a>The fallibility of observation statements</h3><p>&emsp;eg:the earth is stationary was a fact confirmed by observation. After alll, one cannot see or feel it move,and if we jump in the air, the earth does not spin away beneath us.<br><br>&emsp; eg: the sizes of the planets Venus and Mars as viewed from earth.<br><br>&emsp;<font color="red">summary:</font>Both kinds of difficulyt suggest that maybe the observable basis for science is not as straightforward and secure as is widely and traditionally supposed.</p>

The challenge, in science, is to arrange the observable situation in such a way that the reliance on such judgments is minimised if not eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="Galileo-and-the-moons-of-Jupiter"><a href="#Galileo-and-the-moons-of-Jupiter" class="headerlink" title="Galileo and the moons of Jupiter"></a>Galileo and the moons of Jupiter</h3><p>&emsp; Galileo use his power to persuade other people to believe that using telescope is trustworthy.<br><br>&emsp;<font color="red">summary:</font>Galileo was in a strong position to argue for the veracity of his observations of Jupiter’s moons, in spite of the fact that they were invisible to the naked eye.</p>

They are objective insofar as they can be publicly tested by straightforward procedures, and they are fallible insofar as they may be undermined by new kinds of tests made possible by advances in science and technology.</p>

To acquire facts relevant for the identification and specification of the various processes at work in nature it is, in general, necessary to practically intervene to try to isolate the process under investigation and eliminate the effects of others. In short, it is necessary to do experiments.</p>

J. Thomson showed that the science result can be influenced by historical examples, because of the progress of technology. It was improved technology and improved understanding of the situation that made it possible for Thomson to improve on and reject Hertz’s experimental results.<br><br>&emsp;<font color="red">summary:</font>A point to be stressed here is that experimental results are required not noly to be adequate, in the sense of being accurate recordings of what happened, but also to be appropriate or significant.</p>

The strongest possible claim would be that the theory can be logically derived from the facts. That is, given the facts, the theory can be proven as a consequence of them.</p>
<h3 id="Baby-logic"><a href="#Baby-logic" class="headerlink" title="Baby logic"></a>Baby logic</h3><p>&emsp; some basic logic knowledge showed in this part, and I don’t think there is something new that we can get.</p>

Also we can give the example of black swan.<br><br>&emsp;<font color="red">summary:</font>General scientific laws invariably go beyond the finite amount of observable evidence that is available to support them, and that is why they can never be proven in the sense of being logically deduced from that evidence.</p>
<h3 id="What-constitutes-a-good-inductive-argument"><a href="#What-constitutes-a-good-inductive-argument" class="headerlink" title="What constitutes a good inductive argument?"></a>What constitutes a good inductive argument?</h3><p>&emsp; A first attempt at an answer to this question involves the demand that, if an inductive inference from observable facts to laws is to be justified, then the following conditions must be satisfied:<br><br>&emsp;<font color="green">1. The number of observations forming the basis of a generalisation must be large<br><br>&emsp;2. The observations must be repeated under a wide variety of conditions.<br><br>&emsp;3. No accepted observation statement should conflict with the derived law.</font><br><br>&emsp;<font color="purple">debate:<br><br>&emsp;1. Let us consider Condition 1, the demand for large numbers of observations. One problem with it is the vagueness of “large”. The problems do not stop here. There are many instances in which the demand for a large number of instances semems inappropriate.(such as nuclear warfare)<br><br>&emsp;2. Condition 2 has serious problems too, stemming from difficluties surrounding the question of what counts as a significant variation in circumstances.(how to judge what will influence the result of experiments?)<br><br>&emsp;3. About the problem of Condition 3 will be discussed in the CHAPTER 7(since little scientific knowledge would survive the demand that there be no known exceptions)</font></p>
<h3 id="Further-problems-with-inductivism-归纳主义"><a href="#Further-problems-with-inductivism-归纳主义" class="headerlink" title="Further problems with inductivism(归纳主义)"></a>Further problems with inductivism(归纳主义)</h3><p>&emsp; Let us call the position according to which scientific knowledge is to be derived from the observable facts by some kind of inductive inference inductivism and those who subscribe to that view inductivists.<br><br>&emsp;<font color="red">summary:</font><br><br>&emsp;1. If we take contemporary scientific knowledge at anything like face value, then it has to be admitted that much of that knowledge refers to the unobservable.(such as DNA)<br><br>&emsp;2. Another problem stems from the fact that many scientific laws take the form of exact, mathematically formulated laws. Compared with the exactness of such laws we have the inexactness of any of the measurements that constitute the observable evidence for them.<br><br>&emsp;3. A third problem for the inductivist is an lod philosophical chestnut called the problem of induction. it must be justified either by an appeal to logic or by deriving it from experience.<br><br>&emsp;<font color="red">the final result:</font><br>However, what constitutes a valid deductive argument can be specified with a high degree of precision, whereas what constitutes a good inductive argument has not been made at all clear.</p>

Through a famous test of Einstein’s theory of general relativity carried out by Eddington in 1919.<br>He arrived at his key idea that scientific theories are falsifiable.</p>
<h3 id="A-logical-point-in-favour-of-falsificationism"><a href="#A-logical-point-in-favour-of-falsificationism" class="headerlink" title="A logical point in favour of falsificationism"></a>A logical point in favour of falsificationism</h3><p>&emsp; According to falsificationism, some theories can be shown to be false by false by an appeal to the results of observation and experiment.<br><br>&emsp;The falsity of universal statements can be deduced from suitable singular statements. </p>

If it is to form part of science, a hypothesis must be falsifiable. If a theory is to have informative content, it must run the risk of being falsified.</p>
<h3 id="Degree-of-falsifiability-clarity-and-precision"><a href="#Degree-of-falsifiability-clarity-and-precision" class="headerlink" title="Degree of falsifiability, clarity and precision"></a>Degree of falsifiability, clarity and precision</h3><p>&emsp; For the falsificationist, it follows fairly readily from this that the more falsifiable a theory is the better, in some loose sense of more.<br><br>&emsp;eg: the author propose an example between<br><br>(a): Mars moves in an ellipse around the sun<br><br>(b): All planets move in ellipses around their sun<br>(b) has a higher status than (a) as a piece of scientific knowledge. Law (b) tells us all that (a) tells us and more besides Law (b), the preferable law, is more falsifiable than (a).<br><br>&emsp;<font color="red">summary:</font> Highly falsifiable theories should be preferred to less falsifiable ones, then, provided they have not in fact been falsified. <font color="pink"> We learn from our mistakes.</font> The demand that theories should be highly falsifiable has the attractive consequence that theories should be clearly stated and precise. A similar situation exists with respect to precision.</p>
<h3 id="Falsificationism-and-progress"><a href="#Falsificationism-and-progress" class="headerlink" title="Falsificationism and progress"></a>Falsificationism and progress</h3><p>&emsp; The progress of science as the falsificationist sees it might be summed up as follows. Science starts with problems, problems associated with the explanation of the behaviour of some aspects of the world or universe.<br><br>&emsp;<font color="red">summary:</font> From the foregoing, it is clear that the concept of progress, of the growth of science, is a conception that is a central one in the falsificationist account of science.</p>

A hypothesis should be more falsifiable than the one for which it is offered as a replacement.<br><br>The sophisticated falsificationist account of science, with its emphasis of the growth of science, switches the focus of attention from the merits of single theory to the relative merits of competing theories.</p>
<h3 id="Increasing-falsifiability-and-ad-hoc-modifications"><a href="#Increasing-falsifiability-and-ad-hoc-modifications" class="headerlink" title="Increasing falsifiability and ad hoc modifications"></a>Increasing falsifiability and ad hoc modifications</h3><p>&emsp;The demand that as a science progresse its theories should become more and more falsifiable, and consequently have more and more content and be more and more informative, rules out modifications in theories that are designed merely to protect a theory from a threatening falsification.<br><br>&emsp; eg: A interesting that we should know is that Galileo use a completely wrong theory proposed by his rival to beat his rival about the observation of moon.<br><br>&emsp;<font color="red">summary:</font> Modifications of a theory in an attempt to overcome a difficuly need not be ad hoc(特设的)(such as the discovery of Neptune).</p>

A confirmation will confer some high degree of merit on a theory if that confirmation resulted from the testing of a novel prediction.</p>
